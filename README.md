# ProcessorLC-2222
Currently working on pipelining to handle data hazards and branch prediction for better efficiency. Interrupt handling has also been added to the current working version (not shown below). 
Implemented datapath and microcontrol unit using CircuitSim LC-2222. Wrote microcode for 3 ROM microcontrol unit based on LC-2222 ISA.
